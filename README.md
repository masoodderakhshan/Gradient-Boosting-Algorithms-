## 📌 Abstract

Bio-stabilization with plant roots offers a sustainable solution in geotechnical engineering, yet accurately modelling the mechanical behaviour of these composites remains a challenge. This study evaluates the performance of four gradient boosting algorithms—CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and GradientBoosting—for predicting the stress-strain response of unsaturated clayey silt reinforced with Nandina domestica roots. A comprehensive dataset was generated from direct shear tests conducted under varying moisture content (W), root weight density (RWD), depth, and normal stress (NS). Using a 70/30 training-testing split, all four models showed robust generalization in 5-fold cross-validation (mean R² = 0.90–0.92). On the held-out test data, the models yielded exceptional accuracy. LightGBM was the top-performing model with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.995, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.9 kPa, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.6 kPa. The remaining models also performed strongly, with R² values from 0.98 to 0.991. These results validate the capacity of boosting algorithms to capture the complex, non-linear behaviour of root-soil systems, positioning them as powerful and efficient tools for geotechnical analysis and design.
